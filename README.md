# Python_Web_Scraping

#### Here I have created a doing web scraping project in python.For this I have designed frontend using HTML, CSS and Javascript while for working with backend, Flask framework in python is used.
#### I have designed a website which takes the data related to latest technologies from a site, scrapes it and generates an automatic post, which further can be  downloaded as an image and shared on social media handles.
