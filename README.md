# Python_Web_Scraping

### Here I have created a doing web scraping project in python.For this I
have designed frontend using HTML, CSS and Javascript
while for working with backend, Flask framework in python
is used.
### I have designed a website which takes the data related to
latest technologies from a site, scrapes it and generates an
automatic post, which further can be downloaded as an
image and shared on social media handles.
